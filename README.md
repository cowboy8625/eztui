# What is eztui

Eztui is a crate for making TUI's
[Text User Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface)
in the terimal.
The Back end is using
[crossterm](https://docs.rs/crossterm/0.18.2/crossterm/)
so that should make eztui cross platform compatible.
I have tried to make this crate as simple to use and make a TUI's in Rust.
For more details, please check out the [Road Map](#roadmap) for Eztui.

# Why Make TUI

Well that's a good question, and mostly I made this TUI crate to just learn and see if
it was possible for me. Now that there is something working it will be used for a few
things from these three things below.
   * <b>[Revim](https://github.com/cowboy8625/revim)</b> will be one of the next things I work on.
   * <b>Some Kind of Text Game</b> Would be really cool to make.
   * <b>[ReChat](https://github.com/cowboy8625/rechat-gui-client)</b> is a Chat App that I am working on in a GUI using [fltk](https://crates.io/crates/fltk)
   as GUI Crate but at some point I would like to make ReChat-TUI version cause that is way cooler.

I have always been enamored by things in the terminal so it was only a matter of time before this
crate was going to be made.

# Roadmap

In the section I will update as I develop eztui.

   * <b>Add Key Input Support</b> will be one of the next things I work on for This crate.
   * <b>Windows Holding Windows</b> will probably be a thing by 0.0.3
